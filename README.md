# Active Record Associations Quiz

It's time to check your knowledge! Use this quiz to create a custom study guide.
Note any answers that were marked incorrect, so you can study the relevant
material and try this quiz again.  
If you don't know the answer to a question, please do not guess. Instead, select
"I don't know". It's OK not to know everything and to admit when we're unsure.

If you get stuck, check out these pages from the Rails guides:

- [Rails Routing: Nested Resources](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html#nested-resources)
