# Displaying Associated Data

We're working on a domain where a **song belongs to an album**.

When a user makes a `GET` request to `/songs/:id`, we want to return a JSON
response that includes the song along with its associated album, like so:

```json
{
  "id": 10,
  "title": "All Star",
  "artist": "Smash Mouth",
  "album": {
    "id": 2,
    "title": "Shrek: Music from the Original Motion Picture",
    "year": 2001
  }
}
```

What code would you write to return the album associated with one specific song
as a nested object in the response?

Fill in the blank in the code below:

```rb
class SongsController < ApplicationController
  def show
    song = Song.find(params[:id])
    render json: song, _________
  end
end
```

## Correct

include: :album

## Correct

include: [:album]
