# Active Record Associations

To create the following relationship:

- A **team** has many **players**
- A **player** belongs to a **team**

What foreign keys would need need to be added to what database tables?

Select all that apply:

## Incorrect

Add a `team_id` foreign key to the `teams` table.

> A foreign key should refer to the primary key from another table (unless we're
> creating a self-joining relationship, which is not the case here), so there's
> no need to create a foreign key on the `teams` table that refers to the
> primary key on the `teams` table.

## Incorrect

Add a `player_id` foreign key to the `teams` table.

> If we were to add a `player_id` key to the `teams` table, that would establish
> the opposite of the relationship we're after. A `player` should belong to a
> `team`, not the other way around.

## Correct

Add a `team_id` foreign key to the `players` table.

> Right on!

## Incorrect

I don't know.
