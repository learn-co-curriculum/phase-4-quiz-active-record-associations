# Deleting Associated Data

We're working on a domain where a **song belongs to an album**. Before we can
delete an album from the database, we must delete all the songs associated with
that album; otherwise, the songs will still exist without knowing which album
they're associated with.

Which of the following code blocks will help to delete all the songs associated
with an album when the album is deleted?

## Correct

```rb
class Album < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :songs, dependent: :destroy
end
```

> Right! A song **depends on** an album in our domain; we can't have a song that
> doesn't have an associated album. We can use the `dependent` option of the
> `has_many` macro to add behavior to the `Album` class so that before an album
> is deleted, its associated songs are deleted first.

## Incorrect

```rb
class Song < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :album, dependent: :destroy
end
```

> Not quite. A song **depends on** an album in our domain; we can't have a song
> that doesn't have an associated album. Therefore, we must add some additional
> behavior to the `Album` class so that before an album is deleted, its
> associated songs are deleted first.

## Incorrect

I don't know.
