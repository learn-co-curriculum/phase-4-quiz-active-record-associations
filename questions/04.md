# Active Record: Nested Routing

We're working on a domain where an **album has many songs**. Which of the
following nested routes follow RESTful routing conventions? Select all that
apply:

## Correct

`/albums/:album_id/songs`

> Correct! Since an album has many songs, we can represent this relationship by
> nesting a route that will return a list of songs under the route that will
> return one individual album.

## Correct

`/albums/:album_id/songs/:id`

> Correct! Since an album has many songs, we can represent this relationship by
> nesting a route that will return a list of songs under the route that will
> return one individual album, and we can also access one song from this list
> using the song's ID.

## Incorrect

`/songs/:song_id/albums`

> Not quite. Since a song can only belong to one album, it doesn't make sense to
> have a route that lists multiple albums nested under a route for displaying an
> individual song.

## Incorrect

`/songs/:song_id/albums/:id`

> Not quite. Since a song can only belong to one album, it doesn't make sense to
> have a route that lists multiple albums nested under a route for displaying an
> individual song.

## Incorrect

`/songs?album_id=1`

> While you could make this route work, it doesn't take advantage of RESTful
> conventions to represent the relationship between songs and albums in a
> meaningful way.

## Incorrect

I don't know.
