# Active Record: Deleting Nested Data

We're working on a domain where a&nbsp; **song belongs to an album**. Before we
can delete an album from the database, we must delete all the songs associated
with that album; otherwise, the songs will still exist without knowing which
album they're associated with.

&nbsp;

Which of the following code blocks will help to delete all the songs associated
with an album when the album is deleted?&nbsp;

## Correct

```
class Album < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :songs, dependent: :destroy
end
```

## Incorrect

```
class Song < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :album, dependent: :destroy
end
```

## Incorrect

I don't know.
