# Displaying Associated Data

We're working on a domain where an **album has many songs**.

When a user makes a `GET` request to `/albums/:id`, we want to return a JSON
response that includes the album along with its associated songs, like so:

```json
{
  "id": 2,
  "title": "Shrek: Music from the Original Motion Picture",
  "year": 2001,
  "songs": [
    {
      "id": 10,
      "title": "All Star",
      "artist": "Smash Mouth"
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "title": "Best Years of Our Lives",
      "artist": "Baha Men"
    }
  ]
}
```

Fill in the blank in the code below. What code would you write to return all the
songs associated with an album?

```rb
class AlbumsController < ApplicationController
  def show
    album = Album.find(params[:id])
    render json: album, _________
  end
end
```
